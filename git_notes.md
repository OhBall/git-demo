## Motivations
  - Git is used industry wide
  - Allows us to backup and share our code

## Basics
  - The working directory is where you can see and edit your code.
  - The staging area is where we prepare our code for commit
  - Committing code means that these changes will be official changes in the git history of our code.
  - Our entire code history is available to us in our git repository.
  - git config --local user.username 'your username'
  - git config --local user.name 'your name'
  - git config --local user.email 'your email'
## Branching
  - A git branch is a branched off version of our code
## Remotes
